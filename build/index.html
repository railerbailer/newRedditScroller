Reddit is a forum which gives the user the possibility to scroll through posts, but not for pictures and videos / gifs specificly. Therefore this site was created to give the user the ability to fast scroll through different subreddits and find the pictures, videos and gifs that are hidden within the posts. This website is inspired from the website Nuttit which was shut down about a year ago. We are always looking to improve and would love any critizism that you can give.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="footerDiv"></div></div></div></div><script src="/static/js/main.d030a06f.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
